# Windows Machine Learning Explorer Sample

Windows Machine Learning Explorer is a data driven and generic sample application that serves as a 
launch pad to bootstrap ML models to be evaluated by Windows ML. It currently includes a scenario of 
circuit board defect detection model that can detect defects on pictures and a real-time camera feed 
of a printed circuit board.
